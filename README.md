# Data-Analysis-of-a-Document-Tracker

## About the Project

We have created an application that analyses and displays the tracking data. The application is made to run from a standalone executable or a Python script when used in a Command Line Interface (CLI). The application's Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be launched from CLI. No inaccurate data is assumed and expected from this data
